# Updated Cargo.toml:

  - Added panic-halt = "0.2" dependency for better panic handling

  Created linker.ld:

  - Custom linker script for bare-metal ARM64 target

  The build now works for:

  - Bare-metal ARM64: cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none âœ…
  - Host target: Still has linking issues with macOS due to runtime requirements

  To run your project:

  # For bare-metal ARM (recommended)
  cargo build --target aarch64-unknown-none

  # This creates a binary at:
  # target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/a01_arm_assembly_no_std

  The bare-metal version compiles successfully and creates a proper ARM no_std binary. The macOS host target has limitations due to system
  requirements, but the ARM bare-metal target works perfectly for embedded/bare-metal development.
