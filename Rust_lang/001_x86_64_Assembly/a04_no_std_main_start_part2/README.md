  Key Features:

  1. #![no_std] - Disables the standard library
  2. #![no_main] - Tells Rust not to use the usual main function entry point
  3. Panic Handler - Custom panic handler since we can't use the default one
  4. #[unsafe(no_mangle)] - Ensures the function name isn't mangled by the compiler
  5. extern "C" - Uses C calling convention for platform compatibility
  6. -> ! - Never return type (diverges)

  How it works:

  The example demonstrates a minimal embedded-style program that:
  - Performs simple arithmetic (42 + 24 = 66)
  - Runs in an infinite loop (typical for embedded systems)
  - Uses only the core library (not std)
  - Includes proper error handling with a panic abort strategy

  This is a trustworthy no_std foundation that can be extended for embedded systems, kernel development, or other bare-metal
  applications.
